The car's JLR D6a platform is based on a shortened version of the XK's platform. It is the so-called "spiritual successor" to the famous E-Type
            The car was launched initially as a 2-door soft-top convertible, with a 2-door fastback coup√© version launched in 2013. The F-Type underwent a facelift for the 2021 model year.
