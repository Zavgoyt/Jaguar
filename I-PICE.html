        <div><p>The Jaguar I-Pace was designed by Ian Callum. The concept version of the car, described as a five-seater sports car, was unveiled by JLR at the 2016 Los Angeles Motor Show and shown on-road in London in March 2017.
            The I-Pace is built by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, and the production version of the I-Pace was revealed in Graz on 1 March 2018.
            Some of the electric drive technology[which?] has come out of the Jaguar I-Type electric Formula E racing car programme, and the concentric motors were developed by JLR engineer Dr. Alex Michaelides.</p></div>
        <div><p>The Jaguar I-Pace launched with a WLTP-rated range of 292 miles (470 km) and an EPA-rated range of 234 miles (377 km). In December 2019, software enhancements were released to increase range to an EPA-rated range of 246 miles (396 km). The car has a wade depth[clarification needed] of 500 mm (20 in). The rear boot holds 656 litres (23 cu ft), along with 28 litres (1 cu ft) of front boot space. The drag coefficient is 0.29.</p></div>
